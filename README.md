# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
*How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
User needs are turned into user stories and those are a powerful tool for defining the program to be built. User needs deliver the value the customer is looking for. A part of being agile, is putting the user first.

*How does creating “user stories” help with this? 
User stories keep the user the primary focus of the project. A user story defines why the project is being built and why it has value. It is the end goal, from the perspective of the end user.

*How do I approach developing programs? 
Define, plan, code, test, and document. Define the input/output based on the user stories. Plan which parts to complete during a sprint. Code small incremental steps with a team to have a functioning piece of code at the end of the sprint. Testing is a continuous ongoing process through the sprint. Finally, there should be some level of documentation of the program thus far based on the definition of done for the sprint.

*What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
Agile and Scrum are approaches that allow for flexibility, accommodate changes, and allow for faster development. Use the process to create iterative development and have working code at the end of each sprint.

*What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
The ability to collaborate in a team setting, to be disciplined, self-organized, and willingness to learn from other team members. It also calls for accountability as the team works together toward a common goal.
